# Task 1: Build a moon on webpage

1. Create a page with a black background.
2. Create a white circle that represents the moon.
3. The diameter of the moon should roughly be the same to the diameter of real moon when it is observed from earth, this applies to all devices.
4. The moon should always be positioned on the right side of the viewport about 1/4 of the screen. And 1/5 from the top of the viewport.
5. When the moon is clicked, the moon will be enlarged and gradually morphing into a rectangular box that is positioned in the vertical and horizontal center of the viewport (middle of the screen) with an explaination of "how did you calculate the diameter of the moon" in it. If there is too much text to display, a scrollbar is allowed.

# Task 2: Runaway cat

# A few words before you start

1. It is OK if your implementations are not perfect.
2. You are allowed to use any library but please don't copy the answer straight from somewhere else.
3. We won't check your answer with IE5.5 and Netscapes, latest browsers please.
4. If you have time and you want to add transition animation, building process, tests ... etc etc for the little projects, you are more than welcome to do it.
